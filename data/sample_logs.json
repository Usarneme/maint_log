Remove any brackets, zip ties, or wire runs/coverings. Remove the bolt holding the wire to the engine ground. Inspect the new wire to ensure it is the same size, has same terminals, and is in good condition. Strip the end of the secondary ground on the new/replacement wire.

Remove the out and in fuel line bolts. Loosen and slide off the bracket. Pull out the old filter; be prepared for gas to leak and spill. Compare parts to ensure they match. Make sure the fuel filter is replaced in the same orientation (OUT towards engine, IN comes from the gas tank). Check the O-rings on the in and out fuel line ends; replace if necessary. Slide the new filter in. Semi-tighten the in and out bolts. Position and tighten the hold bracket. Tighten all connections. When going to start the engine turn the key to on, then turn it off 2-3 times to prime the pump and put gas in the lines and filter. After the third time start the engine then immediately look at the new fuel filter to ensure there are no leaks. ",
