Make sure the fuel filter is replaced in the same orientation (OUT towards engine, IN comes from the gas tank). Check the O-rings on the in and out fuel line ends; replace if necessary. Slide the new filter in. Semi-tighten the in and out bolts. Position and tighten the hold bracket. Tighten all connections. When going to start the engine turn the key to on, then turn it off 2-3 times to prime the pump and put gas in the lines and filter. After the third time start the engine then immediately look at the new fuel filter to ensure there are no leaks. ",

After removing all bolts, drain the fluid into a catch container. Once drained remove the filter and inspect. Compare the new replacement filter with the old to ensure they are the same size and shape. Ensure the filter gasket isn't stuck up in the transmission so you don't have two gaskets. Lube the gasket with some transmission oil. Install the filter. Install the pan, don't over tighten the bolts. Measure how much oil you removed and replace with new oil via the transmission dip stick tube. Half quart at a time as you get close, allow to settle and measure with the dip stick. Once the level looks close start the engine, warm up, and with foot on brake shift slowly through the gears to distribute the new oil. Do this a few times as you top off and measure the oil level. Do not overfill. Check level again over the next few trips/days. ",
